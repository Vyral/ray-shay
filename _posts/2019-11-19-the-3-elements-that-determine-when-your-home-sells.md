<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Today we’ll discuss the three top elements that determine whether your home sells, and for the best price.</em></p>

Today we’re going to be talking about what determines when your house sells, and if it sells for top price. What are the three biggest elements you need to know as a seller? Whether your home is FSBO (For Sale By Owner), you sell with our company, or another company, these three components will help your home sell faster:&nbsp;

**1\. How well is your home promoted?** How well does your Realtor get it out locally, nationally, and internationally? We personally pay good money to get our listings on several websites, we have certified international property specialists, and a multilingual staff. We also have a newspaper and send out 12,000 newspapers a month. Particularly in our area code, people like seeing that newspaper and looking at the properties.

**2\. How nice is your home?** Make your home look the best you possibly can. It’s important to stage your home. Remember that less is more. Enhance the house the best you can. Don’t overspend, but you can improve a few things to get the maximum price.&nbsp;

**3\. Where do you price your home?** Too often people price it too high because that’s what they want to get. You should price it so that you get activity, where you get people coming in to see the home. Especially in today’s market conditions, you want to boost the number of people viewing the house.

Frequently, the first week is when you’ll get the best offers. Many people want to live here in San Diego—it’s a wonderful place to live. I personally live in Paseo Del Sur with my sons.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email we’ll be happy to help you.
