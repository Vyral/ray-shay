*There are eight reasons why now’s the perfect time to sell your home.*

**Here are the top eight reasons it makes sense to sell now in the 92127 ZIP code:**

**1\.** You’ll sell for top dollar.

**2\.** Current market conditions tend to create multiple-offer situations.&nbsp;

**3\.** Your home will sell above its appraised value.&nbsp;

**4\.** You’ll get favorable terms—many sellers can get 30-, 60-, and even 90-day rentbacks for free because buyers are so hungry for homes.&nbsp;

**5\.** You’ll save $250,000 (if you’re single) or $500,000 (if you’re married) on capital gains taxes if you’ve lived in your home for two out of the last five years.

**6\.** You can reinvest (or “hopscotch”) by buying a new home in the same area.

**7\.** You can prompt a lifestyle change.&nbsp;

**8\.** The market turns quickly. For six months, many banks haven’t been reporting people missing their mortgage payments. Could there be a market shift in six months? No one knows, but it’s something to monitor. Only time will tell.&nbsp;
