<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are a few notes about what’s going on in real estate these days.</em></p>

Today I have a few notes to share about our current real estate environment.

Appraisals have become a large issue lately because homes are selling for more than what they appraise for. We’re great at countering so the buyer knows that we’re not splitting the difference; they’re responsible for covering the difference in price. We’re very clear in the terms and conditions that there are no appraisal contingencies.&nbsp;

You should also keep the terms in mind. **There are many opportunities for sellers to make the most out of their investment.** This may mean a free, two-month rent-back or a variety of other things we can adjust in the terms. Both the price and terms are essential.

If you’re single and have lived in your house for two of the last five years, you’re allowed to exclude up to $250,000 worth of capital gains tax. If you live with a partner or spouse, you can exclude up to $500,000. Right now we’re seeing a lot of people sell their property, take the $500,000, and put it toward buying a new home.

We’ll be seeing changes in the real estate market in the next six months to a year because there are a lot of people currently out of work.

**We want you all to be safe; we care about you.** When you go out, please wear a mask—they don’t look that bad. If you have any questions about the topics I discussed today or real estate in general, please call us at (858) 449-4970 or email us. We would love to help you.
