Our local housing market is on fire, and there are eight reasons why.

Why is our local housing market so hot? There are eight reasons, in particular:

**1\. Limited inventory.** In other words, there aren’t many homes for sale&nbsp;

**2\. Record-low interest rates.** Right now they’re below 3%, which has *never* happened before.&nbsp;

**3\. Safety.** Everyone wants to feel safe, and the 92127 ZIP code promotes a culture of safety.&nbsp;

**4\. School systems.** About 90% of all buyers look at school systems before deciding where to buy, and our school district is exceptional.&nbsp;

**5\. Master planned.** Whether it’s Del Sur, Santa Luz, Crosby, etc., there are some great communities in our area working together to provide many items on this list.&nbsp;

**6\. Family friendly.** I’ve raised three sons in this area, so believe me when I say there’s a sense of friendliness everywhere you go.&nbsp;

**7\. Diversity.** We have a diverse, thriving mix of cultures.&nbsp;

**8\. Value.** When you combine the previous items on this list with our proximity to the ocean, you get a valuable marketplace.&nbsp;

If you have questions about our 92127 market or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m here to help.
