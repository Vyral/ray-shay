When selling your home, staging is of the utmost importance. Let’s discuss why.

When it comes to listing a home, there is one simple step that can make a world of difference in your results: staging. Even in a space as small as the corner that’s featured in today’s video, adding tasteful decor can totally transform an area’s look. The majority of buyers these days will make up their mind about whether they want to come visit your home in about 2.5 seconds when they browse through its listing photos online. Therefore, staging is a must. This is why our team brings in a professional designer to every single home we list—because doing so is one of the best ways to guarantee that our clients sell faster and for more money. Of course, as with anything, too much of a good thing can quickly have the opposite effect. So when it comes to staging, less is more. These are just the kind of tips we’ll share when you meet with us to talk about your real estate goals, so if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.
