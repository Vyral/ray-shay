<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a quick update on how life has changed for Shay Realtors since COVID-19.</em></p>

The pandemic has changed all our lives and many of our businesses. Shay Realtors is no exception, so today I wanted to talk about some of the ways the pandemic has changed us.

**First, one thing that hasn’t changed is our respect for small business owners.** We’ve been trying to support small businesses whenever we can and we see how hard they’re fighting.

One big change is with our families. I’ve been spending more time with my family, doing more cooking, and relaxing a little more.

We’ve also started using electric scooters at our office for our agents putting up open house signs in order to not block streets and lower our carbon emissions.&nbsp;

**The biggest change with the pandemic is that it has slowed us down a little bit.** We’ve been doing a lot more business virtually and haven’t really been able to see many of our clients. Let’s hang in there, make it through the holidays, and hopefully we can get back to more of a normal life in 2021.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us or need any real estate help, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
