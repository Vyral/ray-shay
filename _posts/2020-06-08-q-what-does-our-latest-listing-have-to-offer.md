<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We shot aerial footage of our latest listing just to capture its glory.</em></p>

Today I’m at 15217 Cayenne Creek Court with my phenomenal team of international agents: Tu Nguyen, Kathy Choi, and Tina Wu. We’re excited to showcase this amazing home\! At 0:37 in the video above, you’ll be able to enjoy a video tour. This beauty, complete with tasteful solar panels and a sprawling backyard with an inground pool, is located near top-rated schools and sports parks.&nbsp;
