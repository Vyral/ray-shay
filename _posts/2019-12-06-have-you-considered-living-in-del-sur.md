<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’ve never heard of the Del Sur community and its strong HOA, allow me to fill you in.</em></p>

Today I want to shine a quick spotlight on the great community of Del Sur. There are many things to enjoy about this community (I live there, myself), but I want to specifically mention its strong homeowners association. Del Sur has many great parks, and most homeowners associations have a spa, swimming pool, and a lap pool. All of these amenities are within walking distance for you and your family. Del Sur’s HOA is also very well-funded. Each home sale within the HOA dedicates 0.25% of its profit to the HOA, and these homes are worth anywhere from $800,000 to $1.6 million. With this fund, they can put on all sorts of great community events.

If you want to know more about Del Sur and how their HOA works, don’t hesitate to give my team and me a call. We’d love to speak with you.
