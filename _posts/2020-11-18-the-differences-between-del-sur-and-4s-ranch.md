<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the differences between the Del Sur and 4S Ranch communities.</em></p>

We sell a ton of homes, and two of the main areas we work in are the Del Sur and 4S Ranch communities. People often ask me, “Are you the local expert?” The answer is yes, my team and I are the local experts in the 92127 ZIP code; **we’ve been here for over 20 years, and we provide excellent service.** Both Del Sur and 4S Ranch are exceptional communities with low crime rates, but today I’m explaining a few of the differences between them.

In Del Sur, you have higher fees; for example, the HOA fees will be higher, and there’s also a 2.5% transfer fee every time a home is sold in this community. That means they have a very wealthy HOA with enough funds to provide fantastic events. They have carnivals, bring in snow for holiday events, and more. Del Sur has smaller yards but shared swimming pools, jacuzzis, gathering places, etc. It’s an outstanding place to live.

4S Ranch has one of the county’s largest sports parks on the east side and very low HOA fees. This is a diverse, terrific community. Here you’ll find bigger yards, and more people have their own pools.
