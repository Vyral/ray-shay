Come tour 15630 Hayden Lake Place with me; it’s an amazing home\!

It has five bedrooms, a second-generation suite downstairs, **it’s at the end of a cul-de-sac, has a fantastic view, and the neighborhood has a guard and gated entry.** You need to see this house; you’re going to love it\! To see a tour of this great home, watch the video above.&nbsp;
