<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Let me explain why it’s a great time to sell in Southern California—and why not just anyone can sell a home.</em></p>

Here’s a not-so-new story from Shay Realtors: One of our properties sold after having attracted multiple offers, allowing us to push the price up significantly and work out a great deal for our clients. This tale is indicative not only of the market conditions here in Southern California, but of the value of working with a professional brokerage.&nbsp;

In today’s market, I hear people say, “Anyone can sell a house these days.” They’re almost correct**. You have to be prepared to represent the best interests of your client, something that our team specializes in.** For example, when dealing with multiple offers, you must ensure that you counter out the appraisal contingency. If you receive 10 to 12 offers, why not counter them all instead of just focusing on one? Make sure your agent knows how to do this properly.&nbsp;

You need a fully professional brokerage that understands the ins and outs of negotiations and how to maximize the value of your house. At Shay Realtors, we have a great team of agents that speak Mandarin, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, and Korean in addition to English. We’re ready to meet a diverse range of client needs.&nbsp;

**It’s an amazing time to make the most of your home investment.** Many people have taken losses in the stock markets recently, and more still are pulling their money out, realizing the importance of owning physical assets—especially in a wild climate like this one. People always need a place to live; why not choose a beautiful place like San Diego?&nbsp;
