We all need to do our part during the coronavirus outbreak, but it isn’t very difficult.

Each of us has to be our very best during this health crisis. Stay at home, cooperate in social distancing, wash your hands, follow government regulations, and most importantly, follow the directions of medical professionals. We also need to keep small businesses running; so order food, go through a drive-thru, find a way to support them. We are not just a local but a global community. We can all help one another by staying healthy. Watch the video above to see the faces of our local community, who you may not have thought of, who are working hard through the pandemic, including shopkeepers, firefighters, chefs, cleaners, and many more.&nbsp;
