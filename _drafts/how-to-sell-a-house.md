Today I’m laying out how to sell a home in five simple steps.&nbsp;

What are the main points of selling a home? I’m going to break it down into its simplest terms:

**1\. Prepare the home for sale.** Get the home ready and market it. Whether you’re a FSBO or using a real estate company, you need to market the home everywhere.**&nbsp;**

**2\. Receive offers and find a buyer.** You’ll counter the offers you get, and come to one buyer who is committed to buying your home.**&nbsp;**

**3\. Inspections.** Inspectors will look to see if there’s any water damage, termites, and so on.&nbsp;

**4\. The bank assesses the value.** They will look at comparables in the market.&nbsp;

**5\. Closing on the home sale.** The escrow company works for both the buyer and the seller. They take the money and contracts and make sure everything’s legal.&nbsp;

For buyers, there’s title insurance, which makes sure that the house stays yours once you buy it.&nbsp;

Tip: Don’t always focus on price during a home sale, because the terms are also critical.&nbsp;
